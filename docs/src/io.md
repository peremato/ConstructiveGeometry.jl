!!! warning "Deprecated"

    Since the constructions from this package have started to diverge
    from those of OpenSCAD, (and also since the possibilities for export
    and visualization have improved), OpenSCAD output is being deprecated
    and may be removed in a future version.

## OpenSCAD to Julia conversion.

Might be possible for a limited subset of OpenSCAD language. TODO.
